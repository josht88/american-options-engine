AOE Options — 10-Year Backtest Summary (Static Placeholder)

This repository does not include the full 10-year backtest dataset due to size
and deployment constraints (Streamlit Community Cloud).

Original results (run locally):

• Strategy: Delta-neutral iron condors (defined risk)
• Horizon: ~10 years
• Instruments: Large-cap US equities & ETFs
• Rebalance cadence: ~weekly
• Risk model: Fixed risk per trade, capped exposure

High-level characteristics observed:
• Stable equity curve with bounded drawdowns
• Returns driven primarily by time decay and volatility premium
• Performance sensitive to slippage and execution assumptions

To regenerate full results:
Run the backtest locally using the `backtest_universe` pipeline.

This file exists to keep the UI non-empty on cloud deployments.
